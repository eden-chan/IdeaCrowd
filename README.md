### App to bring similar mindeded people together to build amazing projects


### Flask REST App Developer Installation
1. `pip install pipenv` we use `pipenv` because it VERY easy to manage dependencies
2. `cd RESTApp` to go into the folder containing the application
3. `pipenv install` to install all dependencies for the Flask app. Will also automatically create a venv (see why it is great now?)
4. `pipenv shell` to activate the local enviornment
5. `flask run` to run the app locally
